                <p>Iâ€™m a self-motivated student driven by a deep passion 
                    for leveraging software engineering and machine learning to 
                    effectively address business challenges. I'm continuously 
                    exploring new subjects to stay adaptable in changing 
                    environments, and I enjoy learning and tackling problems 
                    independently or as part of a team by developing coherent 
                    solutions.
                </p>
